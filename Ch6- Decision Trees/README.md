In this Chapter, we will start by discussing how to train, validate, and make predictions with decision trees. Then we will go through the CART training algorithm used by `Scikit-Learn`, we will discuss how to regularize trees and use them in regression tasks. Finally, we will discuss some of the limitations of decision trees.
